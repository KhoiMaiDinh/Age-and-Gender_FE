#### a. **Real-world problem**
The task of predicting age and gender from facial images has garnered significantc attention in recent years due to the ever-expanding applications in computer vision and machine learning. 
While this field has made significant progress, numerous challenges persist. Agerelated facial variations, model stability, and the incorporation of additional attributes such as facial expressions and contextual cues provide ongoing research opportunities. This
study aims to push further in addressing these challenges and contribute to the continuous development of age and gender prediction from facial images.
#### b. **Purpose**
* This research delves into the complex issue of predicting an individual’s age and gender based on their facial features, leveraging the extensive  UTKFace dataset, which provides a vast collection of annotated facial images spanning a wide range of ages and genders. 
* Understanding and predicting age and gender from facial images holds great potential across  various domains.
